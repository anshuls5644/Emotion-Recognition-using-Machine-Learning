# Emotion Recognition using Facial Expressions

## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques. The system processes grayscale facial images and predicts emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutrality. It is designed for applications in mental health analysis, human-computer interaction, and behavioral studies.

## Features
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Extract spatial features from input images.
- **Data Augmentation:** Enhances training data diversity for improved robustness.
- **Dropout Layers:** Prevent overfitting during training.
- **Softmax Activation:** Outputs probabilities for each emotion class.
- **Visualization:** Plots training and validation accuracy/loss for performance analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 35,685 grayscale images (48x48 pixels) of faces categorized into 7 emotions:
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Anger
- Surprise
- Fear
- Disgust
- Neutrality

Images are divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
